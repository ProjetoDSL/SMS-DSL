From a single grammar description, textX constructs Arpeggio parser and a meta-model in run-time. The meta-model contains all the information about the language and a set of Python classes inferred from grammar rules. The parser will parse programs/models written in the new language and construct Python object graph a.k.a. the model conforming to the meta-model.

To support this trend, the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) community has developed advanced techniques for designing new DSLs. However, the widespread use of independently developed, and constantly evolving \{DSLs\} is hampered by the rigidity imposed to the language users by the \{DSLs\} and their tooling, e.g., for manipulating a model through various similar \{DSLs\} or successive versions of a given DSL. In this paper, we propose a disciplined approach that leverages type groups׳ polymorphism to provide an advanced type system for manipulating models, in a polymorphic way, through different \{DSL\} interfaces. A \{DSL\} interface, a.k.a. model type, specifies a set of features, or services, available on the model it types, and subtyping relations among these model types define the safe substitutions. This type system complements the Melange language workbench and is seamlessly integrated into the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), hence providing structural interoperability and compatibility of models between EMF-based tools. We illustrate the validity and practicability of our approach by bridging safe interoperability between different semantic and syntactic variation points of a finite-state machine (FSM) language, as well as between successive versions of the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

However the design handoff to the subsequent phases of the control system development is carried out manually in most cases without much tool support. The approach to agreeing on the control interface between components is a good example where engineers still rely on either manually created Interface Control Documents (ICD) or one off tools implemented by individual projects. Square Kilometer Array (SKA) [2] and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) [3] are two good examples of such large projects adopting these approaches. This results in non-uniformity in the overall system design since individual groups invent their own vocabulary while using a language like SysML which leads to inconsistencies across the design, interface and realized code. To mitigate this, we propose the development of a Monitoring and Control Modeling Language (M&amp;CML), a domain specific language (DSL) [4,22] for specifying M&amp;C solutions. M&amp;C \{ML\} starts with defining a vocabulary borrowing concepts from standard practices used in the control domain and incorporates a language which ensures uniformity and consistency across the M&amp;C design, interfaces and implementation artifacts. In this paper we discuss this language with an analysis of its usage to point out its benefits. "

In order to deal with the complexities of designing and implementing a MAS, a domain-specific language (DSL) can be employed inside the MAS's development cycle. In such a manner, a \{MAS\} can be completely specified by programs written in a DSL. Such programs are declarative, expressive, and at the right abstraction level. In this way the complexity of \{MAS\} development is then partially shifted to \{DSL\} development and the task herein can be much more feasible by using a proper \{DSL\} development methodology and related tools. This paper presents and discusses our methodology for \{DSL\} development based on declarative formal specifications that are easy to compose, and its usage during \{MAS\} development. A practical case-study is also provided covering an example of a MAS's development for expert finding systems. By using denotational semantics for precisely defining the language, we show that it is possible to generate the language automatically. In addition, using attribute grammars makes it possible to have modular methodology within which evolutionary language development becomes easier. "

More precisely, our proposal is to automatically create ontology-based virtual learning environments. Thus, to impart relevant learning materials to the virtual LS, we propose the use of ontologies to represent the key concepts and semantic relations in an user- and machine-understandable format. These concepts together with the data (extracted from the real documents) stored in a digital storage format (XML datasets, relational databases, etc.) are displayed in an ontology-based learning space that enables the visitors to use the available features and tools to learn about a specific domain.

After reviewing the basic concepts characterizing Ontologies and DSLs, we introduce a tool, Onto2Gra, that takes profit of the knowledge described by the ontology and automatically generates a grammar for a \{DSL\} that allows to discourse about the domain described by that ontology. This approach represents a rigorous method to create, in a secure and effective way, a grammar for a new specialized language restricted to a concrete domain. The usual process of creating a grammar from the scratch is, as every creative action, difficult, slow and error prone; so this proposal is, from a grammar engineering point of view, of uttermost importance. After the grammar generation phase, the Grammar Engineer can manipulate it to add syntactic sugar to improve the final language quality or even to add specific semantic actions. The Onto2Gra project is composed of three engines. The main one is OWL2DSL, the component that converts an \{OWL\} ontology into a complete Attribute Grammar for the construction of an internal representation of all the input data. The two additional modules are Onto2OWL, converts ontologies written in OntoDL into standard OWL, and DDesc2OWL, converts domain instances written in the new \{DSL\} into the initial \{OWL\} ontology.

abstract = "Abstract Models have been widely used in the information system development process. Models are not just means for system analysis and documentation. They may be also transformed into system implementation, primarily program code. Generated program code of screen forms and transaction programs mainly implements generic functionalities that can be expressed by simple retrieval, insertion, update, or deletion operations over database records. Besides the program code of generic functionalities, each application usually includes program code for specific business logic that represents application-specific functionalities, which may include complex calculations, as well as a series of database operations. There is a lack of domain-specific and tool-supported techniques for specification of such application-specific functionalities at the level of platform-independent models (PIMs). In this paper, we propose an approach and a domain-specific language (DSL), named IIS⁎CFuncLang, aimed at enabling a complete specification of application-specific functionalities at the \{PIM\} level. We have developed algorithms for transformation of IIS⁎CFuncLang specifications into executable program code, such as PL/SQL program code. In order to support specification of application-specific functionalities using IIS⁎CFuncLang, we have also developed appropriate tree-based and textual editors. The language, editors, and the transformations are embedded into a Model-Driven Software Development tool, named Integrated Information Systems \{CASE\} (IIS⁎Case). IIS⁎Case supports platform-independent design and automated prototyping of information systems, which allows us to verify and test our approach in practice. "

Many dynamic analysis tools rely on program instrumentation and are implemented using low-level instrumentation libraries, resulting in tedious and error-prone tool development. Targeting this issue, we have created the Domain-Specific Language for Instrumentation (DiSL), which offers high-level programming abstractions especially designed for instrumentation-based dynamic analysis. When designing DiSL, our goal was to boost the productivity of tool developers targeting the Java Virtual Machine, without impairing the performance of the resulting tools. In this paper we assess whether DiSL meets this goal. First, we perform a controlled experiment to measure tool development time and correctness of the developed tools, comparing DiSL with a prevailing, state-of-the-art instrumentation library. Second, we recast 10 open-source software engineering tools in DiSL and compare source code metrics and performance with the original implementations. Our studies show that DiSL significantly improves developer productivity, enables concise tool implementations, and does not have any negative impact on tool performance. "

In this paper we detail how programming languages can be implemented in a modular fashion using the Rascal meta-programming language. Rascal supports extensible definition of concrete syntax, abstract syntax and operations on concrete and abstract syntax trees like matching, traversal and transformation. As a result, new language features can be added without having to change existing code. As a case study, we detail our solution of the LDTA'11 Tool Challenge: a modular implementation of Oberon-0, a relatively simple imperative programming language. The approach we sketch can be applied equally well to the implementation of domain-specific languages. "

Since their inclusion in the 5th edition of Java, annotations have grown from a useful tool for the addition of meta-data to play a central role in many popular software projects. Usually they are not conceived in isolation, but in groups, with dependency and integrity constraints between them. However, the native support provided by Java for expressing this design is very limited. To overcome its deficiencies and make explicit the rich conceptual model which lies behind a set of annotations, we propose a domain-specific modelling language. The proposal has been implemented as an Eclipse plug-in, including an editor and an integrated code generator that synthesises annotation processors. The environment also integrates a model finder, able to detect unsatisfiable constraints between different annotations, and to provide examples of correct annotation usages for validation. The language has been tested using a real set of annotations from the Java Persistence \{API\} (JPA). Within this subset we have found enough rich semantics expressible with Ann and omitted nowadays by the Java language, which shows the benefits of Ann in a relevant field of application. "

However, for many domains no \{DSL\} implementation is available and two important reasons for this are: First, the effort to implement \{EDSLs\} that provide the domain’s established syntax (called concrete syntax) is very high. Second, the \{EDSL\} and its underlying general-purpose programming language (GPL) are typically tightly integrated. This hampers reusability across different GPLs. Besides these implementation issues, the productivity gains of using \{EDSLs\} are also limited by the lack of explicit tool support for \{EDSL\} users—such as syntax highlighting or code analyses. In this paper, we present an approach that significantly reduces the necessary effort to implement embedded \{DSLs\} with concrete syntax. The idea is to use island grammars to specify the EDSL’s concrete syntax. This enables the developer to implement the embedded \{DSL\} as a library and to incrementally specify the concrete syntax using meta-data. Only those parts of the EDSL’s grammar need to be specified that deviate from the grammar of the GPL. By analyzing an EDSL’s implementation using reflection, it is possible to provide tool support for \{EDSLs\} without having the developer implement it explicitly, such as syntax highlighting. An evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of our approach by embedding a real-world \{DSL\} into a GPL. "

This new role for domain experts as software developers can have a direct impact on the system safety if the domain experts do not follow software engineering best practices.

However, many of menus available in Internet are not developed in an accessible manner, which creates accessibility barriers for many users, especially users with disabilities. Non-accessible menus hinder users find the information that they are looking for and therefore they can give up accessing the web site. This paper aims at addressing the problem by helping developers to create accessible web menus based on model-driven approach. Adopting this approach can help developers build accessible menus without knowing the technical details about accessibility. In direction to this objective, we initially studied the different types of menus and their structures, as well as the accessibility guidelines that involve creating accessible menus. From the study, we developed a meta-model that originated the \{DSL\} (Domain Specific Language) called \{AMenu\} (Accessible Menu). Then we included all the technical details about accessibility in the transformations. Finally, we presented an exploratory evaluation of DSL, discussing their efficiency and limitations. The results indicate a reduction in efforts for developing accessible web menus, since developers do not have to deal with technical details of accessibility. Our approach provides an alternative to traditional approaches to development for creating accessible web menus. The principles used in this study can be included in \{CASE\} tools and \{IDEs\} with great acceptance in the industry and therefore facilitate and disseminate the development of accessible systems.

However, there are scarce tools and methods supporting their Validation and Verification (V&amp;V), which are essential activities for the proper engineering of meta-models. In order to fill this gap, we propose two complementary meta-model V&amp;V languages. The first one has similar philosophy to the xUnit framework, as it enables the definition of meta-model unit test suites comprising model fragments and assertions on their (in-)correctness. The second one is directed to express and verify expected properties of a meta-model, including domain and design properties, quality criteria and platform-specific requirements. As a proof of concept, we have developed tooling for both languages in the Eclipse platform, and illustrate its use within an example-driven approach for meta-model construction. The expressiveness of our languages is demonstrated by their application to build a library of meta-model quality issues, which has been evaluated over the \{ATL\} zoo of meta-models and some \{OMG\} specifications. The results show that integrated support for meta-model V&amp;V (as the one we propose here) is urgently needed in meta-modelling environments. "

As these regularities express how the source code should be structured, they provide vital information for developers using or extending that code. Adherence to such regularities tends to deteriorate over time because they are not documented and checked explicitly. This paper introduces uContracts, an internal \{DSL\} to codify and verify such regularities as ‘usage contracts’. Our \{DSL\} aims at covering most common usage regularities, while still providing a means to express less common ones. Common regularities are identified based on regularities supported by existing approaches to detect bugs or suggest missing code fragments, techniques that mine for structural regularities, as well as on the analysis of an open-source project. We validate our \{DSL\} by documenting the structural regularities of an industrial case study, and analyse how useful the information provided by checking these regularities is for the developers of that case study.

The selection of a data model for conceptual design, among other things, depends on the problem domain, the knowledge, and the personal preferences of an \{IS\} designer. In some situations, a simultaneous usage of different approaches to the conceptual database design and \{IS\} development may lead to the most appropriate solutions. In our previous research we have developed a tool that provides an evolutive and incremental approach to \{IS\} development, which is based on the form type data model. The approaches based on the Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) and class data models are broadly accepted throughout the community of \{IS\} designers. In order to support the simultaneous usage of approaches based on the form type, \{EER\} and class data models, we have developed the Multi-Paradigm Information System Modeling Tool (MIST). In this paper, we present a part of our \{MIST\} tool that supports \{EER\} approach to a database design. \{MIST\} components currently provide a formal specification of an \{EER\} database schema specification and its transformation into the relational data model, or the class model. Also, \{MIST\} allows generation of Structured Query Language code for a database creation and procedural code for implementing database constraints. In addition, Java code that stores and processes data from the database, may be generated from the class model. In this paper, we present the evaluation study of the \{MIST\} \{EER\} domain-specific language. Users' perceptions of language quality characteristics are used for the evaluation. "

In fact, it is not uncommon for different languages to share common features, and, because in the same project different \{DSLs\} may coexist to model concepts from different problem areas, it is interesting to study ways to develop modular, extensible languages. Earlier work has shown that traits can be used to modularize the semantics of a language implementation; a lot of attention is often spent on embedded DSLs; even when external \{DSLs\} are discussed, the main focus is on modularizing the semantics. In this paper we will show a complete trait-based approach to modularize not only the semantics but also the syntax of external DSLs, thereby simplifying extension and therefore evolution of a language implementation. We show the benefits of implementing these techniques using the Scala programming language. "

Among them, Mixed Interactive Systems (MIS), form a class of interactive systems that comprises augmented reality, tangible interfaces and ambient computing; \{MIS\} aim to take advantage of physical and digital worlds to promote a more transparent integration of interactive systems with the user’s environment. Due to the constant change of technologies and the multiplicity of these interaction forms, specific development approaches have been developed. As a result, numerous taxonomies, frameworks, \{API\} and models have emerged, each one covering a specific and limited aspect of the development of MIS. To support a coherent use of these multiple development resources and contribute to the increasing popularity of MIS, we have developed a framework based on Model-Driven Engineering. The goal is to take advantage of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) standards, methodology and tools to support the manipulation of complementary Domain Specific Languages (DSL), to organize and link the use of different design and implementation resources, and to ensure a rationalized implementation based on design choices. In this paper, we first summarize existing uses of \{MDE\} in \{HCI\} before focusing on five major benefits \{MDE\} can provide in a \{MIS\} development context. We then detail which \{MDE\} tools and resources support these benefits and thus form the pillars of the success of an MDE-based \{MIS\} development approach. Based on this analysis, we introduce our framework, called Guide-Me, and illustrate its use through a case study. This framework includes two design models. Model transformations are also included to link one model to another; as a result the frameworks coverage extends from the earliest design step to a software component-based prototyping platform. A toolset based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) that supports the use of the framework is also presented. We finally assess our MDE-based development process for \{MIS\} based on the five major \{MDE\} benefits for MIS. "

Firstly there are source-code query languages which help software engineers to explore a system, or to find code in need of refactoring as coding standards evolve. These also enable language designers to understand the practical uses of language features and idioms over a software corpus. Secondly there are program analysis tools in the style of Coverity which perform deeper program analysis searching for bugs as well as checking adherence to coding standards such as MISRA. The former class are typically implemented on top of relational or deductive databases and make ad-hoc trade-offs between scalability and the amount of source-code detail held—with consequent limitations on the expressiveness of queries. The latter class are more commercially driven and involve more ad-hoc queries over program representations, nonetheless similar pressures encourage user-visible domain-specific languages to specify analyses. We argue that a graph data model and associated query language provides a unifying conceptual model and gives efficient scalable implementation even when storing full source-code detail. It also supports overlays allowing a query \{DSL\} to pose queries at a mixture of syntax-tree, type, control-flow-graph or data-flow levels. We describe a prototype source-code query system built on top of Neo4j using its Cypher graph query language; experiments show it scales to multi-million-line programs while also storing full source-code detail.

On the Java platform, many \{DPA\} tools are implemented either using aspect-oriented programming (AOP), or rely on bytecode instrumentation to modify the base program code. The pointcut/advice model found in \{AOP\} enables rapid tool development, but does not allow expressing certain instrumentations due to limitations of mainstream \{AOP\} languages—developers thus use bytecode manipulation to gain more expressiveness and performance. However, while the existing bytecode manipulation libraries handle some low-level details, they still make tool development tedious and error-prone. Targeting this issue, we provide the first complete presentation of DiSL, an open-source instrumentation framework that reconciles the conciseness of the \{AOP\} pointcut/advice model and the expressiveness and performance achievable with bytecode manipulation libraries. Specifically, we extend our previous work to provide an overview of the DiSL architecture, advanced features, and the programming model.

It addresses the problem that the design and implementation of a software system often drift apart as software systems evolve, leading to architectural knowledge evaporation. Our approach provides concepts and tool support for the semi-automatic abstraction of architecture component and connector views from implemented systems and keeping the abstracted architecture models up-to-date during software evolution. In particular, we propose architecture abstraction concepts that are supported through a domain-specific language (DSL). Our main focus is on providing architectural abstraction specifications in the \{DSL\} that only need to be changed, if the architecture changes, but can tolerate non-architectural changes in the underlying source code. Once the software architect has defined an architectural abstraction in the DSL, we can automatically generate architectural component views from the source code using model-driven development (MDD) techniques and check whether architectural design constraints are fulfilled by these models. Our approach supports the automatic generation of traceability links between source code elements and architectural abstractions using \{MDD\} techniques to enable software architects to easily link between components and the source code elements that realize them. It enables software architects to compare different versions of the generated architectural component view with each other. We evaluate our research results by studying the evolution of architectural abstractions in different consecutive versions of five open source systems and by analyzing the performance of our approach in these cases.

A consequence of product variety is that manufacturing and assembly processes need to deal with this variety as well. If the variety is low and changes of the product occur infrequently then the variety may be handled by designing the production system for a small set of typical products. But as the variety increases and changes become frequent the necessity for integrated product and production information model is high, to partially solve this problem Product Life Cycle Management (PLM) systems aim at providing an integrated model to all categories of users, e.g. product designers, product preparation engineers, line builders and shop-floor workers. All users need to access the information in the platform and refine and modify the information to reflect new knowledge that has been acquired. Today, most often multiple systems are used where some systems may store information in a structured way but often unstructured text documents are also used. This easily results in redundant information models and automated analysis is not feasible or not event possible because of issues regarding cohesion and traceability of information. The contribution in this paper is to discuss how a new type of tool for building domain specific languages and editors using language workbench approach can be used to support the different user categories in their tasks working with variability of a product and production system while at the same time provide cohesion and traceability of information.

For parts with unusual geometries or intricate intersections between sculpted surfaces, manual intervention is often required when normal tool path generation methods fail to produce efficient tool paths. In this paper, a simplified model of the machining process is used to create a domain-specific language that enables tool paths to be generated and optimised through an evolutionary process - formulated, in this case, as a genetic programming system. The driving force behind the optimisation is a fitness function that promotes tool paths whose result matches the desired part geometry and favours those that reach their goal in fewer steps. Consequently, the system is not reliant on tool path generation algorithms, but instead requires a description of the desired characteristics of a good solution, which can then be used to measure and evaluate the relative performance of the candidate solutions that are generated. The performance of the system is less sensitive to different geometries of the desired part and doesn’t require any additional rules to deal with changes to the initial stock (e.g. when rest roughing). The method is initially demonstrated on a number of simple test components and the genetic programming process is shown to positively influence the outcome. Further tests and extensions to the work are presented. "

The development of groupware systems is a complex task, a problem that can be addressed applying the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) principles and techniques, where the use of models is essential. However, there are no proposals to address all issues to model in this kind of application (group work, shared context, coordination, etc.) and, in particular, there are no proposals that consider the modeling of both interactive and collaborative issues. To solve this deficiency, a domain-specific language (DSL) called Collaborative Interactive Application Notation (CIAN) has been proposed. To define this \{DSL\} a metamodel has been created describing the universe of discourse of the applications supporting interactive group work. We have defined the syntax and semantics of this language. We have also implemented a tool (called CIAT) for supporting the edition and validation of models created with CIAN. This tool has been implemented using the metamodeling facilities provided by the Eclipse platform. Finally, an empirical study was conducted with the aim of verifying the suitability of this approach and the perception of software engineers about its usefulness. The results obtained show that our proposal can facilitate the development process of groupware systems. "

This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between Électricité de France (EDF), \{AREVA\} and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES’s main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems. This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++  (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the \{GPL\} open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/. The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered. In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code_Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the \{PLEIADES\} platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow. We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple \{FFC\} single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.

To generate fully implemented prototypes, these models require a rich representation of the semantics for actions (e.g., database persistence operations). In the development of some use case scenarios for the multi-layered development of web information systems, these design tasks may consume weeks of work even for experienced designers. The literature pointed out that the impossibility for executing a software project with short iterations hampers the adoption of some approaches for design in some contexts, such as start-up companies. A possible solution to introduce design tasks in short iterations is the use of automated design techniques, which assist the production of models by means of transformation tasks and refinements. This paper details our methodology for MDWE, which is supported by automated design techniques strictly associated with use case patterns of type CRUD. The novelty relies on iterations that are possible for execution with short time-scales. This is a benefit from automated design techniques not observed in \{MDWE\} approaches based on manual design tasks. We also report on previous experiences and address open questions relevant for the theory and practice of MDWE. "

Federations of experimental platforms (aka testbeds) offer a controlled and cost-effective solution to perform such an evaluation. Most recent efforts in that area focused on building those facilities and providing experimenters with tools to allow the discovery and provisioning of their shared resources. Many challenges remain in order to support the complete experiment life cycle in a federated environment. We propose OMF-F, a framework which allows the definition of networking experiments and their execution over shared resources provided by different federated administrative domains. OMF-F provides a domain-specific language enabling rich event-based experiment descriptions. It defines a specific resource model and protocol, which together with its publish-subscribe messaging system allows automatic experiment orchestrations at a large scale. OMF-F further provides interfaces to operate with existing resource discovery and provisioning tools for federated testbeds. Our contributions in this paper are threefold. First we provide detailed descriptions of OMF-F’s design, its architecture, and its involved entities. Then, we present a quantitative evaluation of its underlying messaging and event-handling systems. Finally, we discuss two real examples of OMF-F deployed and used on federated domains to define and execute experiments. "

Yet the architects of electric/electronic systems need design boundaries to make decisions during architecture evolutionary design without adding a risk of late changes. Correct selection of safety mechanisms from alternatives at early design stages is vital for time-to-market of critical systems. In this paper we present and discuss an iterative architecture design and refinement process that is centered around \{ISO\} 26262 requirements and model-based analysis of safety-related metrics. This process simplifies identification of the most sensitive parts of the architecture, selection of the best suitable safety mechanisms to reduce thereby failure rate on the system level and improve the metrics defined by the standard. To support the defined process we present the metamodels that can be integrated with existing \{DSL\} (domain-specific language) frameworks to extend them with information supporting further extraction of fault propagation behavior. We provide a framework for architecture model analysis and selection of safety mechanisms. We provide details on the model-based toolset that has been developed to support the proposed analysis and synthesis methods, and demonstrate its application to analysis of a steer-by-wire system model and selection of safety mechanisms for it.

Often role-based policies must implement organizational rules to satisfy compliance or authorization requirements, e.g., the principle of separation of duty (SoD). To provide business continuity, organizations should also support the delegation of access rights and roles, respectively. This, however, makes access control more complex and error-prone, in particular, when delegation concepts interplay with SoD rules. Objective A systematic way to specify and validate access control policies consisting of organizational rules such as SoD as well as delegation and revocation rules shall be developed. A domain-specific language for \{RBAC\} as well as delegation concepts shall be made available. Method In this paper, we present an approach to the precise specification and validation of role-based policies based on \{UML\} and OCL. We significantly extend our earlier work, which proposed a UML-based domain-specific language for RBAC, by supporting delegation and revocation concepts. Result We show the appropriateness of our approach by applying it to a banking application. In particular, we give three scenarios for validating the interplay between SoD rules and delegation/revocation. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formalize advanced \{RBAC\} concepts, such as history-based SoD as well as various delegation and revocation schemes, with \{UML\} and OCL. With the rich tool support of UML, we believe our work can be employed to validate and implement real-world role-based policies. "

These activities thus require a good understanding of a metamodel and/or its parts. Current metamodel editing tools are based on standard interactive visualization features, such as physical zooms. Objective However, as soon as metamodels become large, navigating through large metamodels becomes a tedious task that hinders their understanding. So, a real need to support metamodel comprehension appears. Method In this work we promote the use of model slicing techniques to build interactive visualization tools for metamodels. Model slicing is a model comprehension technique inspired by program slicing. We show how the use of Kompren, a domain-specific language for defining model slicers, can ease the development of such interactive visualization features. Results We specifically make four main contributions. First, the proposed interactive visualization techniques permit users to focus on metamodel elements of interest, which aims at improving the understandability. Second, these proposed techniques are developed based on model slicing, a model comprehension technique that involves extracting a subset of model elements of interest. Third, we develop a metamodel visualizer, called Explen, embedding the proposed interactive visualization techniques. Fourth, we conducted experiments. showing that Explen significantly outperforms EcoreTools, in terms of time, correctness, and navigation effort, on metamodeling tasks. Conclusion The results of the experiments, in favor of Explen, show that improving metamodel understanding can be done using slicing-based interactive navigation features. "

Over a decade of research on \{MDS\} has resulted in a large number of publications. Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR ) is essential. Method: We conducted an extensive \{SLR\} on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary \{MDS\} studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified, strictly selected, and reviewed 108 \{MDS\} publications. Results: The results of our \{SLR\} show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified primary \{MDS\} studies. For example, regarding security modelling artefact, we found that developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many \{MDS\} approaches. The current limitations in each \{MDS\} artefact are pointed out and corresponding potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the identified primary \{MDS\} studies into 5 significant \{MDS\} studies, and other emerging or less common \{MDS\} studies. Finally, some trend analyses of \{MDS\} research are given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains supporting the \{MDS\} development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the application of \{MDS\} methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this \{SLR\} is the first in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy with database searching. This combination has delivered an extensive literature study on MDS. "

Although a diverse collection of cloud resources (e.g., servers) is available, choosing the most optimized and cost-effective set of cloud resources for a given web application and set of quality of service (QoS) goals is not a straightforward task. Optimizing cloud resource allocation is a critical task for offering web applications using a software as a service model in the cloud, where minimizing operational cost while ensuring QoS goals are met is critical to meeting customer demands and maximizing profit. Manual load testing with different sets of cloud resources, followed by comparison of test results to QoS goals is tedious and inaccurate due to the limitations of the load testing tools, challenges characterizing resource utilization, significant manual test orchestration effort, and challenges identifying resource bottlenecks. This paper introduces our work using a modeling framework – \{ROAR\} (Resource Optimization, Allocation and Recommendation System) to simplify, optimize, and automate cloud resource allocation decisions to meet QoS goals for web applications, including complex multi-tier application distributed in different server groups. \{ROAR\} uses a domain-specific language to describe the configuration of the web application, the \{APIs\} to benchmark and the expected QoS requirements (e.g., throughput and latency), and the resource optimization engine uses model-based analysis and code generation to automatically deploy and load test the application in multiple resource configurations in order to derive a cost-optimal resource configuration that meets the QoS goals.

Unlike other process perspectives, such as control flow, for which many different types of analyses have been proposed, such as finding deadlocks, there is an important gap regarding the human resource perspective. Resource analysis in business processes has not been defined, and only a few analysis operations can be glimpsed in previous approaches. In this paper, we identify and formally define seven design-time analysis operations related to how resources are involved in process activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a wide variety of resource-aware \{BP\} models, those analysis operations can be automated by leveraging Description Logic (DL) off-the-shelf reasoners. To this end, we rely on Resource Assignment Language (RAL), a domain-specific language that enables the definition of conditions to select the candidates to participate in a process activity. We provide a complete formal semantics for \{RAL\} based on \{DLs\} and extend it to address the operations, for which the control flow of the process must also be taken into consideration. A proof-of-concept implementation has been developed and integrated in a system called CRISTAL. As a result, we can give an automatic answer to different questions related to the management of resources in business processes at design time. "

The most successful organisations undertake these acquisitions as efficiently as possible. For large organisations, a set of goals may be satisfied – to varying degrees – by any one of a large number of potential resource combinations, and so it is necessary to consider the trade-offs exhibited by each combination to find an effective System of Systems architecture. In this paper, we present an approach, supported by tools, that combines techniques from the fields of goal-modelling and multi-objective optimisation to effectively explore these high-level organisational trade-offs. The decision maker can state the organisational problems and provide high-level descriptions of the existing and acquirable systems using a custom domain specific language. The tool then explores the space of potential resource combinations using a multi-objective genetic algorithm and provides the decision maker with a Pareto front of acquisition plans that represent the best trade-offs between the various goals and costs. Furthermore, the technique and tool enables acquisitions to be scheduled to take an account of such factors as maintenance costs, existing system retirement dates, upfront costs for bringing new systems into service, the budgetary constraints of the organisation and how this affects the organisation's ability to satisfy its goals through the acquisition. The approach is evaluated on a realistic case study in which new systems are acquired to support a military scenario whilst considering the existing in-place systems and through-life implications. "

To assist in this activity, a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) called Sequencer has been developed to enable the improved definition of measurement procedures. With Sequencer, the level of abstraction has been raised and sophisticated changes in measurement procedures are now enabled. Although there are numerous \{DSMLs\} like Sequencer in the existing literature, there are some obstacles working against the more widespread adoption of \{DSMLs\} in practice. One challenge is the lack of supporting tools for DSMLs, which would improve the capabilities of end-users of such languages. For instance, support for debugging a model expressed in a \{DSML\} is often neglected. The lack of a debugger at the proper abstraction level limits the domain experts in discovering and locating bugs in a model. In this paper, Sequencer is presented together with debugging facilities (called Ladybird) that are integrated in a modeling environment. Ladybird supports different execution modes (e.g., steps, breakpoints, animations, variable views, and stack traces) that can be helpful during the debugging of a model. Ladybird's primary contribution is in showing the value of error detection in complicated industrial environments, such as data acquisition in automotive testing. The paper contributes to a discussion of the implementation details of \{DSML\} debugging facilities and how such a debugger can be reused to support domains other than the measurement context of Sequencer.

Many domains are not traditionally involved in these types of software problems and must adapt their current processes accordingly. Typically, such requirements are developed ad hoc for each system, preventing further reuse beyond the domain-specific boundaries. This paper proposes a solution for software system development based on the reuse of dedicated subsystems, i.e., so-called dependability patterns that have been pre-engineered to adapt to a specific domain. We use Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) to describe dependability patterns and a methodology for developing dependable software systems using these patterns. Moreover, we describe an operational architecture for development tools to support the approach. An empirical evaluation of the proposed approach is presented through its practical application to a case study in the railway domain, which has strong dependability requirements, to support a pattern-based development approach. This case study is followed by a survey to better understand the perceptions of practitioners regarding our approach. "

However, the design and implementation of such context-aware ubiquitous appplications remain challenging as there exist very few models and tools to guide application designers and developers in mastering the complexity of context information. This becomes even more crucial as context is by nature imperfect. One way to address this issue is to associate to context information meta-data representing its quality. We propose a generic and extensible design process for context-aware applications taking into account the quality of context (QoC). We demonstrate its use on a prototype application for sending flash sale offers to mobile users. We present extensive performance results in terms of memory and processing time of both elementary context management operations and the whole context policy implementing the Flash sale application. The cost of adding QoC management is also measured and appears to be limited to a few milliseconds. We show that a context policy with 120 QoC-aware nodes can be processed in less than 100 ms on a mobile phone. Moreover, a policy of almost 3000 nodes can be instantiated before exhausting the resources of the phone. This enables very rich application scenarios enhancing the user experience and will favor the development of new ubiquitous applications. "

We perform an empirical investigation on compositional analysis of \{DBNs\} using abstraction. In static systems and hidden Markov models, computation of a metric called treewidth induces a tree decomposition that can be used to perform logical or probabilistic inference and max + optimizations in time exponential in treewidth and linear in overall system size. Intuitively, the linear scaling means that very large systems can be analyzed as long as they are sufficiently sparse and well structured. In these simple cases, summary propagation, which uses two operations, summation (projection) and product (composition), suffices to perform the inference or optimization. Here, we begin an extension of this to structured networks of communicating dynamic systems. We define generalizations of projection and composition operators that treat labeled Markov chains as primitive objects. The projection operation, corresponding to summation, is implemented as label deletion followed by exact state reduction for Markov chains, similar to Hopcroft's \{DFA\} minimization algorithm, with O(nlogm) complexity. The composition operation is the product of state machines. We use canonical MDDs, similar to BDDs, to capture logical dependencies symbolically. Combining symbolic representations with Markov chain lumping algorithms is a novel contribution. Using this approach, we have created a tool lever- aging model based systems engineering technologies. The communicating Markov chains are specified using \{UML\} Statecharts via Papyrus extended using an \{ANTLR\} parsed domain specific language (DSL). The tool reduces the number of states in networks of Markov chains by several orders of magnitude. In one example, a network having a product state space of more than 600 million states is reduced to about 500 states. A feature of this technique is that the state space is examined incrementally, meaning that the full state space is never explicitly represented, even as an input to the reduction algorithm. The primary reduction appears to come from symmetry which is surprising because the technique includes no explicit symmetry handling. We note that composition is efficient at least for systems with high symmetry. We describe applications to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) from a systems engineering perspective. "

In fact, building any software system usually involves managing a plethora of APIs, which complicates the development process. In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), where models are the key elements of any software engineering activity, this \{API\} management should take place at the model level. Therefore, tools that facilitate the integration of \{APIs\} and \{MDE\} are clearly needed. Objective Our goal is to automate the implementation of API–MDE bridges for supporting both the creation of models from \{API\} objects and the generation of such \{API\} objects from models. In this sense, this paper presents the \{API2MoL\} approach, which provides a declarative rule-based language to easily write mapping definitions to link \{API\} specifications and the metamodel that represents them. These definitions are then executed to convert \{API\} objects into model elements or vice versa. The approach also allows both the metamodel and the mapping to be automatically obtained from the \{API\} specification (bootstrap process). Method After implementing the \{API2MoL\} engine, its correctness was validated using several APIs. Since \{APIs\} are normally large, we then developed a tool to implement the bootstrap process, which was also validated. Results We provide a toolkit (language and bootstrap tool) for the creation of bridges between \{APIs\} and MDE. The current implementation focuses on Java APIs, although its adaptation to other statically typed object-oriented languages is straightforward. The correctness, expressiveness and completeness of the approach have been validated with the Swing, \{SWT\} and \{JTwitter\} APIs. Conclusion \{API2MoL\} frees developers from having to manually implement the tasks of obtaining models from \{API\} objects and generating such objects from models.

abstract = "Abstract Nowadays, concurrent programs are an inevitable part of many software applications. They can increase the computation performance of the applications by parallelizing their computations. One of the approaches to realize the concurrency is using multi thread programming. However, these systems are structurally complex considering the control of the parallelism (such as thread synchronization and resource control) and also considering the interaction between their components. So, the design of these systems can be difficult and their implementation can be error-prone especially when the addressed system is big and complex. On the other hand, a Domain-specific Modeling Language (DSML) is one of the Model Driven Development (MDD) approaches which tackles this problem. Since \{DSMLs\} provide a higher abstraction level, they can lead to reduce the complexities of the concurrent programs. With increasing the abstraction level and generating the artifacts automatically, the performance of developing the software (both in design and implementation phases) is increased, and the efficiency is raised by reducing the probability of occurring errors. Thus, in this paper, a \{DSML\} is proposed for concurrent programs, called DSML4CP, to work in a higher level of abstraction than code level. To this end, the concepts of concurrent programs and their relationships are presented in a metamodel. The proposed metamodel provides a context for defining abstract syntax, and concrete syntax of the DSML4CP. This new language is supported by a graphical modeling tool which can visualize different instance models for domain problems. In order to clarify the expressions of the language; the static semantic controls are realized in the form of constraints. Finally, the architectural code generation is fulfilled via model transformation rules using the templates of the concurrent programs. To increase level of the DSML׳s leverage and to demonstrate the general support of concurrent programming by the DSML, the transformation mechanism of the tool supports two well-known and highly used programming languages for code generation; Java and C#. The performed experiments on two case studies indicate a high performance for proposed language. In this regard, the results show automatic generation of 79% of the final code and 86% of the functions/modules on average. "

Raising the level of abstraction, particularly with those programs that use visual models, can be an effective aid for domain experts, who are then able to model their programs on their own. This paper describes the design and use of a domain-specific modeling language called the Sequencer, integrated with the measuring equipment DEWESoft, which enables domain experts to model their own data acquisitions. Specifically, in this paper the Sequencer is exposed to: domain concepts identification, the construction of modeling notation, a connection with execution framework, and the end-users’ point of view on the modeling tool. The use of the Sequencer will be presented on car brake tests. For this purpose, the Sequencer has already been successfully applied in the automotive industry. "

Xsemantics aims at reducing the gap between the formalization of a language (i.e., type system and operational semantics) and the actual implementation in Xtext, since it uses a syntax that resembles the rules in a formal setting. In this paper we present the main features of Xsemantics for implementing type systems and reduction rules through examples (Featherweight Java and lambda calculus). We show how such implementations are close to the actual formalizations, and how Xsemantics can be a helpful tool when proving the type safety of a language. We also describe the new features of Xsemantics that help achieving a modular and efficient implementation of type systems. In particular, we focus on specific implementation techniques for implementing type systems that are suited for the \{IDE\} (in our context, Eclipse), in order to keep the tooling responsive and guarantee a good user experience.

Environmental model development requires both scientific understanding of environmental phenomena and software developer proficiency. \{EMFs\} support the modeling process through streamlining model code development, allowing seamless access to data, and supporting data analysis and visualization. \{EMFs\} also support aggregation of model components into functional units, component interaction and communication, temporal-spatial stepping, scaling of spatial data, multi-threading/multi-processor support, and cross-language interoperability.

The agents are considered to be autonomous entities which contain intelligence that serves for solving their selfish or common problems, and to achieve certain goals. However, the autonomous, responsive, and proactive natures of agents make the development of agent-based software systems more complex than other software systems. Furthermore, the design and implementation of a \{MAS\} may become even more complex and difficult to implement when considering new requirements and interactions for new agent environments like the Semantic Web. We believe that both domain-specific modeling and the use of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) may provide the required abstraction, and hence support a more fruitful methodology for the development of MASs. In this paper, we first introduce a \{DSML\} for \{MASs\} called SEA_ML with both its syntax and semantics definitions and then show how the language and its graphical tools can be used during model-driven development of real MASs. In addition to the classical viewpoints of a MAS, the proposed \{DSML\} includes new viewpoints which specifically support the development of software agents working within the Semantic Web environment. The methodology proposed for the \{MAS\} development based on SEA_ML is also discussed including its example application on the development of an agent-based stock exchange system. "

The alignment of internal peptides of \{DBL\} (MS/MS) with known protein sequences revealed similarity to other legume lectins. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of \{DSL\} also aligned with legume lectins. Cross-similarities among the two studied lectins were observed only after sequence permutation. More than a dozen lectins have been reported for the genus Dioclea but none that recognize galactose. \{DSL\} is the first lectin reported for the Deguelia genus in the tribe Millettieae. With the aid of bioinformatics tools and searches for genome/transcriptome information about closely related sequences, new lectin members of Millettieae were also identified. Electrophoresis profiling and amino acid sequence analysis suggested that DBL-Gal and \{DSL\} do not undergo post-transcriptional ConA-like circular permutation. Molecular modeling of the deduced amino acid sequences of the Millettieae lectins suggested that the overall folding of the monomeric structures of legume lectins is conserved. This and other recent studies highlight native plants of the Amazon as renewed sources of lectins. "

Thus, new tools are required in order to adequately monitor and further diagnose anomalies that other segments of the \{DSL\} network cannot identify due to the pragmatic issues raised by hardware or software misconfigurations. In this work we present a fundamentally new approach for classifying known DSL-level anomalies by exploiting the properties of novelty detection via the employment of one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs). By virtue of the imbalance residing in the training samples that consequently lead to problematic prediction outcomes when used within two-class formulations, we adopt the properties of one-class classification and construct models for independently identifying and classifying a single type of a DSL-level anomaly. Given the fact that the greater number of the installed Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) within the \{DSL\} network of a large European \{ISP\} were misconfigured, thus unable to accurately flag anomalous events, we utilize as inference solutions the models derived by the one-class \{SVM\} formulations built by the known labels as flagged by the much smaller number of correctly configured \{DSLAMs\} in the same network in order to aid the classification aspect against the monitored unlabeled events. By reaching an average over 95% on a number of classification accuracy metrics such as precision, recall and F-score we show that one-class \{SVM\} classifiers overcome the biased classification outcomes achieved by the traditional two-class formulations and that they may constitute as viable and promising components within the design of future network fault management strategies. In addition, we demonstrate their superiority over commonly used two-class machine learning approaches such as Decision Trees and Bayesian Networks that has been used in the same context within past solutions.

Active targeting is achieved through polymeric ligands on the liposome surface. The liposomes were prepared using reverse phase evaporation method and doxorubicin hydrocholoride, a model drug, was loaded using the ammonium sulphate gradient method. Liposomes loaded with \{DOX\} were found to have a particle size of 200 nm with more than 90% entrapment efficiency. Systems were observed to release the drug in a sustained manner in acidic pH in vitro. Liposomes containing targeting ligands possessed greater and selective toxicity to \{ASGPR\} positive HepG2 cell lines due to specific ligand receptor interaction. Bio-distribution studies revealed that liposomes were concentrated in the liver even after 3 h of administration, thus providing conclusive evidence of targeting potential for formulated nanosystems. Tumor regression studies indicated greater tumor suppression with targeted liposomes thereby establishing superiority of the liposomal system. In this work, we used a novel methodology to guide the determination of the optimal composition of the targeting liposomes: molecular dynamics (MD) simulation that aided our understanding of the behaviour of the ligand within the bilayer. This can be seen as a demonstration of the utility of this methodology as a rational design tool for active targeting liposome formulation. "

Models are normally described using Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs), which provide primitives and constructs of the domain. Still, the increasing complexity of systems has raised the need for abstraction techniques able to produce simpler versions of the models while retaining some properties of interest. The problem is that developing such abstractions for each \{DSML\} from scratch is time and resource consuming. In this paper, our goal is reducing the effort to provide modeling languages with abstraction mechanisms. For this purpose, we have devised some techniques, based on generic programming and domain-specific meta-modeling, to define generic abstraction operations that can be reused over families of modeling languages sharing certain characteristics. Abstractions can make use of clustering algorithms as similarity criteria for model elements. These algorithms can be made generic as well, and customized for particular languages by means of annotation models. As a result, we have developed a catalog of reusable abstractions using the proposed techniques, together with a working implementation in the MetaDepth multi-level meta-modeling tool. Our techniques and prototypes demonstrate that it is feasible to build reusable and adaptable abstractions, so that similar abstractions need not be developed from scratch, and their integration in new or existing modeling languages is less costly.

In the context of screening and priority-setting tools for PBT-assessment, the cumulative \{PBT\} Index model, implemented in \{QSARINS\} (QSAR-INSUBRIA), new software tool for the development and validation of multiple linear regression \{QSAR\} models, offers a new holistic approach for the identification of chemicals with cumulative \{PBT\} properties directly from their molecular structure. In this study the Insubria \{PBT\} Index in \{QSARINS\} is applied to the screening and prioritization of various data sets, containing a large variety of chemicals of heterogeneous molecular structure, previously screened by various authors by different methods, for their potential \{PBT\} behavior. Particular attention is devoted to the model Applicability Domain, using different approaches such as Descriptor Range, Leverage, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the modeling molecular descriptors, in order to discriminate between interpolated and extrapolated predictions. The results of this screening, which is based only on the molecular structure features and is not dependent on single threshold values for P, B and T, are compared with those obtained by the on-line US-EPA \{PBT\} Profiler. Good agreement between the various approaches is found, supporting the utility of a consensus approach in priority-setting studies. The main discrepancies are highlighted and commented on. Moreover, a priority list containing the most hazardous compounds identified in agreement between the two tools is drafted. The \{PBT\} Index, implemented in QSARINS, which was demonstrated to be a practical, precautionary and reliable screening tool for PBT-behavior directly from the molecular structure, can be usefully applied for focusing experimental studies, and even before chemical synthesis, in a “benign by design” approach of safer alternatives.

abstract = "Abstract Phospholipid vesicles of less than 1 μm are present in blood in physiological state and their concentration may vary under pathological conditions. Various names such as exosomes (EXS) and microparticles (MPS) have been used to designate these extracellular vesicles (EVS). Although \{EXs\} and \{MPS\} possibly arise from separate mechanisms, they share numerous similarities representing a challenge for their purification and characterization. These vesicles generally originate from various types of cells such as red blood cells, platelets, leukocytes or endothelial cells but also from tumor cells. They participate in numerous biological processes including hemostasis. It is therefore of major scientific interest to characterize the protein content of these different types of \{EVS\} and that of their membranes in order to elucidate the essential functions of these dynamic vesicular compartments. Proteomics has been shown to be a particularly adequate tool in this study field. This review attempts to link proteomic data with physiological roles and functions of blood EVS. "

abstract = "Summary Assessing the amount of bioavailable cortisol in saliva with immunoassays and thus sampling an endocrine marker of hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis activity is of major interest in both research and clinical practice. However, absolute cortisol concentrations obtained with different immunoassays (IAs) are barely comparable precluding direct comparison between studies or individuals whenever cortisol analyses were not based on the same IA. The present technical report aims to solve this problem by evaluating the validity of, as well as agreement between the most commonly used immunoassays in psychoneuroendocrinological research (i.e., IBL, DRG, Salimetrics, DSL, and DELFIA) and a reference method (LC–MS/MS) in a sample of 195 saliva specimen covering the whole range of cortisol concentrations in adults. A structural equation modelling framework is applied to decompose systematic assay variance and estimate cortisol reference values, which are adjusted for measurement error and interference of salivary cortisone. Our findings reveal nonlinear relations between \{IAs\} and LC–MS/MS, which are discussed in terms of \{IA\} cross-reactivity with saliva matrix components. Finally guidelines for converting cortisol concentrations being obtained by these immunoassays into comparable reference values are proposed by providing conversion functions, a conversion table, and an online conversion tool.

This community may be created around the wiki itself (e.g., community of contributors in Wikipedia) or already exist (e.g., company employees in corporate wikis). In the latter case, the wiki is not created in a vacuum but as part of the information ecosystem of the hosting organization. As any other Information System resource, wiki success highly depends on the interplay of technology, work practice and the organization. Thus, wiki contributions should be framed along the concerns already in use in the hosting organization in terms of glossaries, schedules, policies, organigrams and the like. The question is then, how can corporate strategies permeate wiki construction while preserving wiki openness and accessibility? We advocate for the use of “Wiki Scaffoldings”, i.e., a wiki installation that is provided at the onset to mimic these corporate concerns: categories, users, templates, articles initialized with boilerplate text, are all introduced in the wiki before any contribution is made. To retain wikis' friendliness and engage layman participation, we propose scaffoldings to be described as mind maps. Mind maps are next “exported” as wiki installations. We show the feasibility of the approach introducing a Wiki Scaffolding Language (WSL). \{WSL\} is realized as a plugin for FreeMind, a popular tool for mind mapping. Finally, we validate the expressiveness of \{WSL\} in four case studies. \{WSL\} is available for download. "

abstract = "Abstract Plasma anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations have been recently found to be predictive of the number of embryos recovered after \{FSH\} superovulatory treatment in the cow. However, the sensitivity of the Active Müllerian-inhibiting substance/AMH \{ELISA\} (ref. 10–14400; DSL-Beckman-Coulter) used to make these measurements in bovine plasma samples is low because it was developed to measure human \{AMH\} levels. To overcome this limitation, we developed an immunoassay specific for the bovine (B), ovine (O), and caprine (C) species, the bovine-ovine-caprine (BOC) ELISA. For this purpose, we produced recombinant bovine \{AMH\} for standardization, and we used monoclonal antibodies raised against bovine AMH, previously prepared by our laboratory. We evaluated the precision, accuracy, specificity, limit of detection, and functional sensitivity of the assay. The intra-assay coefficient of variation ranged between 3.4% and 11.3% for \{AMH\} concentrations between 23.68 and 1.74 ng/mL, and the interassay coefficient of variation ranged between 4.8% and 20.5% for concentrations between 25.53 and 1.42 ng/mL, respectively. The assay displayed a good linearity, had a detection limit of 0.4 ng/mL and a functional sensitivity of 1.4 ng/mL. It also cross-reacted with ovine and caprine AMHs. Both the mean and median \{AMH\} levels measured in 40 cow plasma samples using the \{BOC\} \{ELISA\} were approximately 44 fold higher than the mean and median \{AMH\} levels measured with the Active Müllerian-inhibiting substance/AMH ELISA. Moreover, a higher correlation was observed between the average number of embryos recovered from each cow after superovulatory treatment and \{AMH\} concentrations measured with the \{BOC\} ELISA. This BOC \{ELISA\} provides a very efficient tool for evaluating the ovarian follicular reserve of cows and predicting their embryo production capacity. "

The pattern formation is distinct from Drosophila but somewhat resembles a vertebrate. Notch signaling is involved in the segmentation of vertebrates and spiders. Here, we studied the function of Notch signaling in silkworm embryogenesis via \{RNA\} interference (RNAi). Depletion of Bmdelta, the homolog of the Notch signaling ligand, led to severe defects in segment patterning, including a loss of posterior segments and irregular segment boundaries. The paired appendages on each segment were symmetrically fused along the ventral midline in Bmdelta \{RNAi\} embryos. An individual segment seemed to possess only one segmental appendage. Segmentation in prolegs could be observed. Our results show that Notch signaling is employed in not only appendage development but also body segmentation. Thus, conservation of Notch-mediated segmentation could also be extended to holometabolous insects. The involvement of Notch signaling seems to be the ancestral segmentation mechanism of arthropods.

As computational power is increasing, scientists are able to explore ever more complex models in finer detail and to explain very complex real world data. This work provides an overview of one-, two- and three-dimensional diffusion models for penetration into mammalian skin. Besides diffusive transport this includes also binding of substances to skin proteins and metabolism. These models are based on partial differential equations that describe the spatial evolution of the transport process through the biological barrier skin. Furthermore, the work focuses on analytical and numerical techniques for this type of equations such as discretization schemes or homogenization (upscaling) techniques. Finally, the work compares different geometry models with respect to the permeability. "
