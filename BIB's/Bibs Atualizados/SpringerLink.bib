title="On the reuse and recommendation of model refactoring specifications",
journal="Software {\&} Systems Modeling",
year="2013",
volume="12",
number="3",
pages="579--596",
abstract="Refactorings can be used to improve the structure of software artefacts while preserving the semantics of the encapsulated information. Various types of refactorings have been proposed and implemented for programming languages (e.g., Java or C{\#}). With the advent of (MDSD), a wealth of modelling languages rises and the need for restructuring models similar to programs has emerged. Since parts of these modelling languages are often very similar, we consider it beneficial to reuse the core transformation steps of refactorings across languages. In this sense, reusing the abstract transformation steps and the abstract participating elements suggests itself. Previous work in this field indicates that refactorings can be specified generically to foster their reuse. However, existing approaches can handle certain types of modelling languages only and solely reuse refactorings once per language. In this paper, a novel approach based on role models to specify generic refactorings is presented. Role models are suitable for this problem since they support declaration of roles which have to be played in a certain context. Assigned to generic refactoring, contexts are different refactorings and roles are the participating elements. We discuss how this resolves the limitations of previous works, as well as how specific refactorings can be defined as extensions to generic ones. The approach was implemented in our tool Refactory based on the (EMF) and evaluated using multiple modelling languages and refactorings. In addition, this paper investigates on the recommendation of refactoring specifications. This is motivated by the fact that language designers have many possibilities to enable refactorings in their modelling languages with regard to the language structures. To overcome this problem and to support language designers in deciding which refactorings to enable, we propose a solution and a prototypical implementation.",

abstract="Non-trivial software systems integrate many artifacts expressed in multiple modeling and programming languages. However, even though these artifacts heavily depend on each other, existing development environments do not sufficiently support handling relations between artifacts in different languages. By means of a literature survey, tool prototyping, and experiments, we study the design space of multi-language development environments (MLDEs)---tools that consider cross-language relations as first artifacts. We ask: What is the state of the art in the MLDE space? What are the design choices and challenges faced by tool builders? To what extent are MLDEs desired by users, and what aspects of MLDEs are particularly helpful? Our main conclusions are that (a) cross-language relations are ubiquitous and troublesome in multi-language systems, (b) users highly appreciate cross-language support mechanisms of MLDEs, and (c) generic MLDEs clearly advance the state of the art in tooling for language integration. The technical artifacts resulting from this study include a feature model of the MLDE design space, a data set of harvested cross-language relations in a case study system (JTrac) and two MLDE prototypes, TexMo and Coral, that implement two radically different choices in the design space.",

abstract="Formal methods (such as interactive provers) are increasingly used in software engineering. They offer a formal frame that guarantees the correctness of developments. Nevertheless, they use complex notations that might be difficult to understand for unaccustomed users. On the contrary, visual specification languages use intuitive notations and aiming at easing the specification and understanding of software systems. Moreover, these languages and concomitant environments permit to automatically generate graphical interfaces or editors for Domain Specific Languages starting from a meta-model. However, they suffer from a lack of precise semantics. We are interested in combining these two complementary technologies by mapping the elements of the one into the other. In this paper, we present a generic transformation process from functional data structures, commonly used in proof assistants, to Ecore models and vice versa. This translation method is based on Model-driven engineering and defined by a set of bidirectional transformation rules. These rules are detailed and represented in a formal description. Our approach is implemented in the Eclipse environment and illustrated with a case study.",

abstract="Advances in Cloud computing technology and the availability of affordable and easy to use Cloud services are enabling a multitude of scientific applications to use these resources as primary or secondary computing infrastructure. The urban and built environment research domain is one area that can benefit greatly from Cloud computing. The global population growth and increase in the size and population of cities raise many challenges for governments, planners and researchers alike. The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN---                  http://www.aurin.org.au                                  ) project has been tasked with developing an advanced platform (e-Infrastructure) across Australia to tackle these challenges. The platform leverages large-scale Cloud resources to provide federated data access to, at present over 1100 data sets from major and often definitive government and industry data-rich organisations, and for scalable data processing and visualisation. The original AURIN tools were developed using the object modelling system (OMS) and supported integrated workflows to define and enact/re-enact scientific processes. More recently the work has evolved to focus more on delivery of a workbench offering a rich range of tools delivered through an extensible workflow environment. In this paper, we provide the background to AURIN including the scientific drivers that are shaping the work and the realisation of the Cloud-based AURIN environment. We focus in particular on the workflow environment and show how it seamlessly utilizes the Cloud for urban research processes focused especially on data-intensive spatial analysis. We illustrate the utilisation of this workflow environment across a range of case studies reflecting urban research activities.",

pages="583--600",
abstract="General purpose (GP)GPU programming demands to couple highly parallel computing units with classic CPUs to obtain a high performance. Heterogenous systems lead to complex designs combining multiple paradigms and programming languages to manage each hardware architecture. In this paper, we present tools to harness GPGPU programming through the high-level OCaml programming language. We describe the SPOC library that allows to handle GPGPU subprograms (kernels) and data transfers between devices. We then present how SPOC expresses GPGPU kernel: through interoperability with common low-level extensions (from Cuda and OpenCL frameworks) but also via an embedded DSL for OCaml. Using simple benchmarks as well as a real world HPC software, we show that SPOC can offer a high performance while efficiently easing development. To allow better abstractions over tasks and data, we introduce some parallel skeletons built upon SPOC as well as composition constructs over those skeletons.",

abstract="A way to host a full general purpose virtual machine (VM) interpreter on a very small microcontroller platform is described. This machine provides a comprehensive set of general and enhanced functionality efficiently by abstracting the VM instruction set. Measurements were made on the execution of software programs in the virtual machine while running on the target platform in order to demonstrate the machine's capabilities. Additionally, multitasking capabilities were added to the baseline and found to perform efficiently within the VM. The results proved to be satisfactory and demonstrate that a robust virtual machine can be made available for very small embedded platforms based on simple microcontrollers, such as those that are widely found in aerospace applications.",

  abstract = {As problem-based learning (PBL) is becoming more and more popular, there is also a growing interest in developing and using technologies in the implementation of PBL. However, teachers may have difficulties to design and deliver a pedagogically well-designed and technically smoothly executable online or blended PBL process on their own because they lack appropriate expertise in learning theories and design methods as well as a deeper understanding of the potential affordances of the available technologies. From this premise, we are committed to developing and testing methods and tools to support the design and delivery of online or hybrid PBL processes with high flexibility and a low threshold of usage requirements. This paper presents a technical approach to develop a web-based PBL application that supports both authoring and run-time usage. In comparison with other tools and technical approaches, it is concluded that a combined use of a model-driven approach and semi-structured data management appears to be a promising approach to effectively and efficiently support the authoring, delivering, and execution of design-time and run-time PBL processes.},

Corpus-based analysis can serve as an evaluation mechanism to identify characteristics of the language after it has been deployed by looking at how end-users employ it in practice. This analysis that is based on actual usage of the language brings a new perspective which can be considered by a language engineer when working toward improving the language. In this paper, we describe our utilization of corpus-based analysis techniques and exemplify them on the evaluation of the Puppet and ATL DSLs. We also outline an Eclipse plug-in, which is a generic corpus-based DSL analysis tool that can accommodate the evaluation of different DSLs.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we have investigated the role of dependencies in the design process of mechatronic products. Since explicit modeling of dependencies is largely considered unnecessary today, current languages do not support dependency modeling due to lack of sufficiently expressive language constructs. However, this paper argues that modeling dependencies is important in managing the overall design process. The paper highlights dependencies between two important viewpoints: system design and mechanical design. We have looked closely at how mechanical design (supported by CAD tools) establishes a backbone for the overall design concept. Mechanical design cannot be isolated from other design activities, and the mismanagement of dependencies there leads to problems in other domains too. To illustrate the process, the paper presents an example of modeling dependencies between system hierarchy in OMG SysML{\texttrademark} and the CAD assembly in Solid Edge for a mechatronic design example. The paper presents two different approaches to capturing dependencies---using a general purpose modeling language such as SysML and using a domain specific modeling language (DSML). We argue for using a DSML instead of a general purpose language and provide a DSML called the dependency modeling language (DML). An example DML model for a two degree of freedom robot use case is discussed. The paper also illustrates the complete process of capturing dependencies in a general purpose modeling language like SysML, which served as a good exercise on how to fetch data from a CAD tool and how to represent dependencies inside a significantly different modeling language. Lessons learned from doing this were applied to the construction of DML. Our aim for the future is to reduce the human effort required to build dependency models. Machine learning techniques and automated model transformations are valuable techniques to support this cause.},

For requirements engineering, it is not enough that functional requirements are accurately defined and considered in software development but vital non-functional requirements require special attention because they often are cross-cutting concerns and difficult to interpret during design. Not only requirements have to be carefully considered but they also have to be implemented and the implementation must be validated against the original requirements. This is facilitated if a bi-directional traceability link between requirements and implementation is maintained. NFR+ Framework supported by a tool enables to do that in the context of Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM). In this publication, we propose a method for applying such a framework supported by a tool to enable maintaining a bi-directional traceability link between in the development process phases with careful attention on maintaining traceability over different typical tool boundaries existing in the context of DSM.},

DSL implementation indeed requires engineers to care for various concerns, from abstract syntax, static semantics, behavioral semantics, to extra-functional issues such as runtime performance. This paper presents an approach that uses one metalanguage per language implementation concern. We show that the usage and combination of those metalanguages is simple and intuitive enough to deserve the term mashup. We evaluate the approach by completely implementing the non-trivial fUML modeling language, a semantically sound and executable subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML).},

  year     = {2015},
  pages    = {1--24},
  abstract = {In model-driven engineering (MDE), a particular MDE setting of employed languages and automated and manual activities has major impact on productivity. Furthermore, it has been observed that such MDE settings evolve over time. However, currently not much is known about this evolution and its impact on the MDE setting's maturity, i.e., on changeability and other productivity dimensions. Research so far focuses on evolution of separate building blocks, such as (modeling-) languages, tools, or transformation, only. In this article, we address the lack of knowledge about evolution of MDE settings by investigating case studies from different companies. The first results reveal (1) that there is evolution that affects the composition of an MDE setting (structural evolution) and has the potential to strongly impact aspects, such as changeability and (2) that this structural evolution actually occurs in practice. Based on these first results, we investigated (3) whether there are cases in practice, where structural evolution already altered the risks of changeability given by the respective MDE setting. Therefore, we search and identify examples for such evolution steps on MDE settings from practice and collected six case studies on evolution histories in detail. As a result, we show in this paper that structural evolution (a) is not seldom in practice and (b) sometimes leads to the introduction of changeability risks.},

  abstract = {In a model-based software product line (MSPL), the variability of the domain is characterized in a variability model and the core artifacts are base models conforming to a modeling language (also called metamodel). A realization model connects the features of the variability model to the base model elements, triggering operations over these elements based on a configuration. The design space of an MSPL is extremely complex to manage for the engineer, since the number of variants may be exponential and the derived product models have to be conforming to numerous well-formedness and business rules. In this paper, the objective is to provide a way to generate MSPLs, called counterexamples (also called antipatterns), that can produce invalid product models despite a valid configuration in the variability model. We describe the foundations and motivate the usefulness of counterexamples (e.g., inference of guidelines or domain-specific rules to avoid earlier the specification of incorrect mappings; testing oracles for increasing the robustness of derivation engines given a modeling language). We provide a generic process, based on the common variability language (CVL) to randomly search the space of MSPLs for a specific modeling language. We develop LineGen a tool on top of CVL and modeling technologies to support the methodology and the process. LineGen targets different scenarios and is flexible to work either with just a domain metamodel as input or also with pre-defined variability models and base models. We validate the effectiveness of this process for three formalisms at different scales (up to 247 metaclasses and 684 rules). We also apply the approach in the context of a real industrial scenario involving a large-scale metamodel.},

  abstract = {High development and maintenance costs and a high error rate are the major problems in the development of automation systems, which are mainly caused by bad communication and inefficient reuse methods. To overcome these problems, we propose a more systematic reuse approach. Though systematic reuse approaches such as software product lines are appealing, they tend to involve rather burdensome development and management processes. This paper focuses on small enterprises. Since such companies are often unable to perform a ``big bang'' adoption of the software product line, we suggest an incremental, more lightweight process to transition from single-system development to software product line development. Besides the components of the transition process, this paper discusses tool selection, DSL technology, stakeholder communication support, and business considerations. Although based on problems from the automation system domain, we believe the approach may be general enough to be applicable in other domains as well. The approach has proven successful in two case studies. First, we applied it to a research project for the automation of a logistics lab model, and in the second case (a real-life industry case), we investigated the approaches suitability for fish farm automation systems. Several metrics were collected throughout the evolution of each case, and this paper presents the data for single system development, clone{\&}own and software product line development. The results and observable effects are compared, discussed, and finally summarized in a list of lessons learned.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the graph-based transformation language GReTL. GReTL is operational, and transformations are either specified in plain Java using the GReTL API or in a simple domain-specific language. GReTL follows the conception of incrementally constructing the target metamodel together with the target graph. When creating a new metamodel element, a set-based semantic expression is specified that describes the set of instances that have to be created in the target graph. This expression is defined as a query on the source graph. GReTL is a kernel language consisting of a minimal set of operations, but it is designed for being extensible. Custom higher-level operations can be built on top of the kernel operations easily. After a description of the foundations of GReTL, its most important elements are introduced along with a transformation example in the field of metamodel integration. Insights into the design of the GReTL API are given, and a convenience copy operation is implemented to demonstrate GReTL's extensibility.},

With service-oriented tool integration, development tools are made available as services, which can be orchestrated to form tool chains. Due to the increasing sophistication and size of tool chains, there is a need for a systematic development approach for service-oriented tool chains. We propose a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) that allows us to describe the tool chain on an appropriate level of abstraction. We present how this language supports three activities when developing service-oriented tool chains: communication, design and realization. A generative approach supports the realization of the tool chain using the service component architecture. We present experiences from an industrial case study, which applies the DSML to support the creation of a service-oriented tool chain. We evaluate the approach both qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing it with a traditional development approach.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Systems interoperability is a key challenge in providing continuity of care to all patients. The challenge is addressed with information standards and new approaches to systems integration based on service-oriented architectures. Model-driven development promise utilities that are suitable for software service development in the healthcare domain, but development tools are still immature and their industry uptake is low. The knowledge about how model-driven development tools can become more useful to the healthcare software developers should be strengthened. Approach: This paper presents the ModelHealth toolchain that was created in four design/assess cycles, involving 28 students and 41 professional developers in the period 2007--2010. The toolchain provides design assistance for creating software services based on concepts from the CEN-13940 standard for continuity of care, which facilitates development of interoperable software services. Results: The CEN-13940 standard was successfully incorporated into the ModelHealth Toolchain assisting developers in creating software service design models that adhered to the standard. The developers expressed that improved understanding of the target system, documentation generation, and artifact traceability were essential utilities of the model-driven approach. Conclusion: The paper concludes healthcare domain knowledge can be successfully incorporated in a model-driven development toolchain, providing valuable input to the healthcare software service design process. A set of recommendations on how to incorporate domain specific concepts into model-driven development tools is provided. To our knowledge, no other scientific publications have reported from healthcare specific model-driven tool design and evaluations. Our recommendations extend and nuance existing knowledge on model-driven development tooling in general.},

This paper summarizes the experiences of three large industrial participants in a European research project with the objective of developing techniques and tools for applying MDE on the development of large and complex software systems. The participants had varying degrees of previous experience with MDE. They found MDE to be particularly useful for providing abstractions of complex systems at multiple levels or from different viewpoints, for the development of domain-specific models that facilitate communication with non-technical experts, for the purposes of simulation and testing, and for the consumption of models for analysis, such as performance-related decision support and system design improvements. From the industrial perspective, a methodology is considered to be useful and cost-efficient if it is possible to reuse solutions in multiple projects or products. However, developing reusable solutions required extra effort and sometimes had a negative impact on the performance of tools. While the companies identified several benefits of MDE, merging different tools with one another in a seamless development environment required several transformations, which increased the required implementation effort and complexity. Additionally, user-friendliness of tools and the provision of features for managing models of complex systems were identified as crucial for a wider industrial adoption of MDE.},

Web modeling tools do not make all types of data validation explicit in their models, hampering full code generation and model expressivity. Web application frameworks do not offer a consistent interface for data validation. In this paper, we present a solution for the integration of declarative data validation rules with user interface models in the domain of web applications, unifying syntax, mechanisms for error handling, and semantics of validation checks, and covering value well-formedness, data invariants, input assertions, and action assertions. We have implemented the approach in WebDSL, a domain-specific language for the definition of web applications.},

This is of paramount relevance for preserving the intellectual property encoded in models and making applications, languages and processes resilient to technological changes. This paper proposes a model-driven approach for supporting the migration and evolution of data-intensive Web applications. In particular, model differencing techniques are considered to realize a migration facility capable of detecting the modifications a model underwent during its lifecycle and to automatically derive from them the programs that are capable of migrating/adapting also those aspects which are not directly derivable from the source models, as for instance the data persistently stored in a database and the page layout usually written using graphic templates. The approach is validated by considering applications described with the beContent and WebML modeling languages.},

  abstract = {Modeling and transforming have always been the cornerstones of software system development, albeit often investigated by different research communities. Modeling addresses how information is represented and processed, while transformation cares about what the results of processing this information are. To address the growing complexity of software systems, model-driven engineering (MDE) leverages domain-specific languages to define abstract models of systems and automated methods to process them. Meanwhile, compiler technology mostly concentrates on advanced techniques and tools for program transformation. For this, it has developed complex analyses and transformations (from lexical and syntactic to semantic analyses, down to platform-specific optimizations). These two communities appear today quite complementary and are starting to meet again in the software language engineering (SLE) field. SLE addresses all the stages of a software language lifecycle, from its definition to its tooling. In this article, we show how SLE can lean on the expertise of both MDE and compiler research communities and how each community can bring its solutions to the other one. We then draw a picture of the current state of SLE and of the challenges it has still to face.},
